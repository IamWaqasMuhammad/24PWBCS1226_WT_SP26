# Lab 01 Report MD

In this lab, I learned the basics of setting up a web technology project and managing it with Git. I practiced creating fundamental files like `index.html`, configuring a `.gitignore` to manage untracked files, and documenting the project's purpose in a `LICENSE` file. Working with branches and merging helped me understand how to experiment safely with changes without affecting the main codebase. Overall, this lab provided a solid foundation for both web development and version control practices.
